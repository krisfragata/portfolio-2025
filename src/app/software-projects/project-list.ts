I found the language to be robust, clean, and I found it refreshing to be able to avoid compiling errors before they happened (looking at you, Typescript). In comparison to the two languages I had extensive experience in (Java, Javascript/Typescript), I found go to be the lovely in-between. Go's package management is reminiscent to Java but isn't as locked into Object Oriented Programming and was perfect for a small project like this. And while Typescript is also statically typed, I find that the Typescript/Javascript un-opinionated workflow is at times, a detriment when starting a small project. Overall, this experience helped me gain better language evaluation skills and understanding of project requirements.",
